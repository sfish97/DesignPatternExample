# Assign6DesignPattern

For this project, I used the Decorator and Strategy Patterns

For the Decorator pattern the requirements I fulfilled were
- Each hero/villain gets has powers
- Heroes are created based on a random event that occurs
- Heroes rest after a battle
- New Villains are clones and get the powers of their "parent". Instead of keeping the levels of each power,
I reset them back to their original base level.

For the Strategy Pattern:
- Villains and Heroes battle each other when they run into each other
- Different strategies are used. Based on what battle it is, both the hero and villains individual power is
increased or decreased.
- The winner gets the losers power
- If the person defeated has a power the winner has, that power level is increased.

Lastly, this project is based on the TV series, Avatar: The Last Airbender. The timing of me re-watching the series
lined up with this project. So I thought this is a cool way to express how much I love the show.
