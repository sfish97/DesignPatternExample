# Assign6DesignPattern

Design Patterns I'll most likly be using will be the Decorator pattern, and Strategy pattern.

For the Decorator pattern, I'll be using it to give villains and heroes thier powers. My plan right now is to have each
hero/villains have a body type that will either give increases or decreases in certain abilites. Then give each of them 1
superpower ability each.

With the strategy pattern, I can create multiple types of battle algortihms with possible weather conditions, they type 
of land the battle is happening, and other factors that can weaken or strengthen abilites.
